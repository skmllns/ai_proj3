TSP and Greedy Search

Alternative solution to Travelling Salesperson Problem. Finds the point closest to an existing edge and integrates it into the path.

RandomX.tsp are sample input files, with X sets of coordinates of points to be visited.

The visualization still needs work, as edges are not always removed once points are added.

Dependencies: Python 2.7, matplotlib
